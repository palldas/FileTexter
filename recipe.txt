Ingredients:

- 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk (or any milk of your choice)
- 1 ripe banana (frozen for a creamier texture)
- 1 scoop of protein powder (whey, plant-based, or your preferred type)
- 1 tablespoon of almond butter or peanut butter (optional for added creaminess and flavor)
- 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt (optional for extra protein and creaminess)
- 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon of honey or maple syrup (adjust to taste for sweetness)
- A handful of ice cubes (optional, for a colder and thicker smoothie)

Instructions:

1. Add the unsweetened almond milk (or your preferred milk) to a blender as the base.
2. Peel the ripe banana and add it to the blender. If you want a creamier texture, use a frozen banana instead.
3. Add one scoop of protein powder to the blender. Choose your preferred type of protein powder, such as whey, plant-based, or any other you like.
4. For added creaminess and flavor, add a tablespoon of almond butter or peanut butter to the blender (optional).
5. If you want an extra protein boost and more creaminess, add half a cup of Greek yogurt to the blender (optional).
6. Add the vanilla extract and sweeten the smoothie with honey or maple syrup according to your taste preference.
7. If you prefer a colder and thicker smoothie, toss in a handful of ice cubes.
8. Blend all the ingredients together until smooth and creamy. If needed, you can add more milk to adjust the consistency.

Your protein smoothie is now ready to be enjoyed! You can pour it into a glass or travel cup and take it on the go or enjoy it as a post-workout snack. Feel free to customize the recipe by adding fruits, vegetables, or other ingredients that you like. Enjoy!
